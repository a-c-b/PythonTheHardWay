## Letterpress Math

Everything is based upon the pica
Fonts are measured in points

12 points = 1 pica

Picas are used to measure furniture, reglets, and leading
Leading comes in 2pt & 6 pt

1 point = 1/72 inch = 1/12 pica

Picas measure: length of leading, width and length of furniture, and length and thickness of reglets
1 pica = 1/6 inch

All spacing is based on the em - which is square.  

12 pt em = 12 pt wide & 12 pt high
12 pt en = 6 pt wide x 12 pt high

one 2pt space = 2 brasses = 4 coppers
